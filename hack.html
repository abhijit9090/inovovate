While direct medical sciences have contributed to most of its advancements, recent years have seen computer sciences compliment it very well. Be it in aggregating services of every doctor in a locality, or a simple application with quick remedies for ailments - the tech party has landed in the healthcare space. Think of how technology can complement the current healthcare infrastructure.

                           Ninety-five percent of the world’s population breathes polluted air. In 2017, air pollution was the cause of 6 million deaths, making it the fourth largest cause of death in the world. Seventy-one percent of the earth’s surface is covered by water, out of which 96.5 percent is in the oceans. The North Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean combined have over 3 million pieces of plastic floating around. This extensive pollution causes the death of over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals every year.

Work towards a safer environment by promoting and ensuring clean air and water are available to people. Create solutions to track and improve the quality of breathable air and water resources around the world.

                            The temperature has risen by over 1.5 degrees since the mid-1800s. If the environment keeps degrading at the current rate, the average temperature could increase by 4-12 degrees by the end of the 21st century. This would lead to catastrophes, making thousands of species extinct and raising the sea level to such an extent that entire cities would be submerged.

Help in tracking and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) effects to decrease global warming and create a sustainable future by developing effective solutions.

                        <div class="text">
                           Every company is now trying to be a data company, capable of using machine learning in the cloud to deploy intelligent apps at scale, thanks to the machine-learning trends. With hosted machine learning models, companies can now quickly analyze large, complex data, and deliver faster, more accurate insights without the high cost of deploying and maintaining machine-learning systems. Application intelligence is the process of using machine-learning technology to create apps that use historical and real-time data to make predictions and decisions to deliver rich, adaptive, personalized experiences for users. We believe that every successful new application built today will be an intelligent application.

Machine learning can be innovative if it proves to be a new way to gain previously impossible insights. It is not yet evident whether those insights are enough to make machine learning disruptive. Even though, the machine-learning field is maturing at this stage, but it still has unanswered questions about whether its efforts use artificially intelligent processes effectively to derive insights from data, and therefore produce actionable intelligence.

Using artificial intelligence to arrive at new insights is a more complex and challenging task than merely getting better quality results through the automation of data processing.

Come up with your own disruptive machine learning application with its relevant use case.
